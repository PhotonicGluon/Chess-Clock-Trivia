*Chess Clock Trivia* is a trivia game where teams answer questions within a certain time limit.

## Setup

1. Appoint a person to be the *Questioner*. This person should **not** be in any of the teams that are playing
   *Chess Clock Trivia*.
2. The *Questioner* should use two devices.
    - All teams should be able to see the screen of one device (e.g. by connecting that device to a projector screen). 
      This is the *Main Device*.
    - The other device (e.g. mobile phone) should access the *Questioner* site. This is the *Questioner Device*.
3. The *Main Device* shows a suggested *Session ID* in pink. The *Questioner* may enter this ID into the input field, 
   or enter a previous session ID.
    - ***IMPORTANT: Do not show the Session ID to the teams***.
4. Enter the **same** *Session ID* into the input field on the *Questioner Device*.
5. Enter values for the **Number of Teams**, **Time Limit (in seconds)** and **Penalty Time
   (in seconds)** on the *Main Device*.
6. The *Questioner* may change any of the teams' names by clicking on **Team XXX** and editing the text there.
7. Once all teams are ready, click **Start The Game!** on the *Main Device*.

## Protocol

Note: in general, the order of the teams goes from **left to right**, with the **first team** being the **left-most** 
team. **That team will go first**.

### For Teams

Here's the protocol to follow for teams in *Chess Clock Trivia*.

- Each team is designated a certain amount of time to answer the questions. This is the **Time Limit (in seconds)** 
  shown near the bottom of the page.
- On a team's turn, a question will be shown on the screen. **Only that team should answer that question**.
- If the team wants to answer the question, **signal to the *Questioner*** that you want to answer the trivia question.
    - The team may do this in a number of ways, but **ensure that the *Questioner* is aware of the signal**.
    - The *Questioner* will **stop the clock** for that team to answer the question.
    - The team then have a few seconds to answer the question. **Do NOT answer the question *before* the Questioner has
      acknowledged that you are answering the question**.
        - If the team takes more than a few seconds (subject to the *Questioner*'s judgement), the team is deemed to 
        - have answered that question **incorrectly**.
    - The team may choose to **skip** the question, but that is the same as answering the question **incorrectly**.
- If that team answers the question **correctly**, the clock will start for the next team (once they are ready). If that
  team answers the question **incorrectly**, a penalty will be given to that team and **their clock starts again** with
  a new question.
- If a team's clock reaches **0**, the game will **pause**. That team is **eliminated** and, when the next team is 
  ready, that team's clock will start.
- The last non-eliminated team **wins**!

### For The *Questioner*

Here's the protocol to follow for the *Questioner* in *Chess Clock Trivia*.

- Before clicking **Start The Game!** on the *Main Device*, ensure both the *Questioner Device* and *Main Device* are
  working.
- Once the **Start The Game!** button is clicked, the first question will be shown on *Main Device*. On the 
  *Questioner Device*, click on **Get Next Question** to show the first question's question and answer.
- When a team signals to the *Questioner*, the *Questioner* should **stop the clock** for that team. That team will now
  have a few seconds to provide an answer.
    - Check that team's answer against the answer shown on the *Questioner Device*. Decide whether that answer is 
      **correct** or **incorrect**.
- If that team answers the question **correctly**, start the clock for the next team (once they are ready). If that 
  team answers the question **incorrectly**, give a penalty to that team by clicking on **Deduct Time** on the 
  *Main Device*. **Start that team's clock again**, and a new question will be shown.
- If any team's clock reaches **0**, the game will **pause** automatically. That team is **eliminated** and, when the 
  next team is ready, the *Questioner* should start that team's clock.
- The last non-eliminated team **wins**.
- To save the current progress of the session, click on **Update Session on Server** on the *Questioner Device*. The
  result of the updating will be shown.
